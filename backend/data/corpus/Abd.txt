6. Establish a National Alcohol Harm Surveillance Dashboard
A transparent, real-time monitoring system is essential for tracking the strategyâ€™s progress. A national alcohol harm surveillance dashboard should be developed to report on key indicators such as emergency department presentations, alcohol-attributable deaths, treatment access, and consumption patterns. This data should be disaggregated by age, gender, geography, and cultural background to inform evidence-based decision-making and improve accountability across jurisdictions.
