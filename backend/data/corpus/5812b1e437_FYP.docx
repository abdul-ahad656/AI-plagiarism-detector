Title: SkillSphere
For our Final Year Project, we are developing Skill Sphere, an all-in-one educational application aimed at enhancing online learning through personalization, flexibility, and intelligent support. Our goal is to create a platform that caters to a wide range of learners including students, professionals, and general knowledge seekers by offering accessible and customizable learning experiences.
Skill Sphere will operate on a freemium model, with a basic version providing structured learning content such as video lectures, quizzes, and assignments, while the premium version will offer live classes, advanced tracking features, customizable content, and access to expert support.
A distinctive feature of our project is the integration of a smart chatbot assistant. This AI-powered chatbot will:
Guide users through the platform.
Answer frequently asked questions.
Recommend courses based on learner behavior and interests.
Offer real-time help to improve the learning experience.
We identified a gap in current e-learning platforms where users often lack interactive and instant support. By incorporating the chatbot, we aim to make learning more responsive, engaging, and user-friendly.
Our project is inspired by leading platforms such as Coursera and Khan Academy, but Skill Sphere sets itself apart by focusing on user support, affordability, and customization. With a compact and efficient team structure, we are committed to continuous improvement of content, features, and user engagement strategies through effective marketing and partnership models.
Ultimately, Skill Sphere represents our vision of building a smart, scalable, and student-centered digital learning ecosystem that not only delivers knowledge but also adapts to the evolving needs of learners in todayâ€™s fast-paced world.
