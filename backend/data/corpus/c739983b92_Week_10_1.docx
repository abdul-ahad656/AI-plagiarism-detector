what is react native?
react native is a cross-platform mobile development framework that lets you build native mobile apps (android & ios) using react and javascript.
key features:
cross-platform: one codebase works on both android and ios.
native performance: it uses native components, not web views, so apps feel fast and smooth.
live & hot reloading: instantly see code changes without restarting the app.
large community: lots of third-party packages and libraries available.
how it works:
you write code in javascript using react syntax.
react native converts it to native code under the hood using bridge architecture.
basic example:
import react from 'react';
import { text, view } from 'react-native';

export default function app() {
  return (
    <view>
      <text>hello, this is a react native app!</text>
    </view>
  );
}
